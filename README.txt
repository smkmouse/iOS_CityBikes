The app develops to allow users search for bike stations near their current location or near a particular address. 

This provides users with rental bike stations information such as: bike station location, number of bikes available, and number of empty docks at a particular station that obtain from API. We get these information from two different APIs: Citi bike and Coord. However, Coord's API is not allowed us to get information anymore since we use free API Key.

You can see clearly our work via our final report.
